Wrote this for a coding test for a company, It is Written in HTML, SCSS and JS. 
Haven't written too much SASS recently so was good to get my head into it a little bit, I wouldn't say it's the best written SASS or it uses all of SASS' features maybe it's something i'll try to implement in the future. 

Also It's not truly responsive only matches the design on two viewports one being Mobile Medium 375px and Laptop 1440px.

After doing some reading on sass/scss and getting my head back into it, i have started to re write my scss into partials which will make the code a lot more cleaner and easier to maintain in the future.

I forgot how powerful scss really is and it's been quite enjoyable to write if i'm honest.
